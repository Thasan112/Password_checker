# Password_checker
Python password checker
This project is a password strength checker that analyzes user-input passwords based on factors such as length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and common weak passwords. It provides feedback to help users create stronger passwords. Built using Python, it can be extended to include additional security checks such as dictionary-based attacks and entropy calculations
